# Transcriptome-Annotation-Pipeline

This pipeline aims to make a transcriptome annotation of the common parakeet, budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus). Here, we utilize bulk RNA-seq data from five samples as well as the reference genome to develop an annotation and search for proteins and regulatory elements, as well as evaluate the genetic connection of the budgerigar to other birds in similar clades or evolutionary regions. 

The user manual explains how to install the pipeline in a few easy steps. Check out our [final report](https://github.com/egaskin/Transcriptome-Annotation-Pipeline/blob/main/final-documents/final-report.pdf)!
